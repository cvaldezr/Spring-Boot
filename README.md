# Spring Boot in Openshift

This example project is for people that want to start playing with Spring Boot in Openshift.

Its based in the hello world located in the [Spring website](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/), I just modify the ```pom.xml``` so the code can be deploy using the Wildfly/Openshift template.

### Features

It includes the following things:

  - Git ignore configuration file.   
  - The Spring[ documentation](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/Spring%20Boot%20Reference%20Guide.pdf) in PDF, HTML version can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/).


### Source Code

In the example every time you make a call to the root URL ```/```, it will send back a greetings message.

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String index() {
        return "Hello World!!";
    }

}
```

## Workflow

### Working in Local

To work in local you can execute:
```sh
  mvn spring-boot:run
```
It's a quick and convenient way to work in your local machine.

## Openshift

### Trying Openshift

If you want to practice in local you can get the [oc-client](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md).

At the moment of writing this document oc-client work best with this old version of [Docker](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/1.13.1.15353/Docker.dmg).


### Deploying in Openshift

To deploy our code, we can create a new application:

```
oc new-app wildfly:10.0~https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot
```

This will create an application by running following steps:

- **Building** This will basically clone the project, fetch all dependencies and push the image the registry.
- **Deploy** As soon as the image is registered, it will be deploy in the form of a Pod, after that will be ready to accept request.

#### Expose

After deployment finish we can check the status of our micro-service using ```oc get pods```, we should see our Pod in **Running** state.

```
NAME                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
spring-boot-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          12m
spring-boot-1-qp4sh   1/1       Running     0          10m
```

Then we need to know the service name ```oc get svc```, we should get something like this:
```
NAME          CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
spring-boot   172.30.76.36   <none>        8080/TCP   17m
```

Now we know the name, we expose the service this way:

```
oc expose svc spring-boot
```

Now our service has a route, we can see the details with ```oc get routes```:

```
NAME          HOST/PORT                             PATH      SERVICES      PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
spring-boot   spring-boot-spring.127.0.0.1.nip.io             spring-boot   8080-tcp                 None
```

Now the best part let's make our first call.

```
curl spring-boot-spring.127.0.0.1.nip.io

Hello World!!
```

### Using Openshift UI

The main difference using this method is that service is automatically expose.

## Configuring Continuous Integration

Now we have an Openshift application (Build, Deploy, Expose), this is very good so far, but I want to orchestrate some test automation for the code, let create a simple pipeline with Jenkins. 

First go to the Openshift console, project catalago and click to create a new Jenkins application, the advantage by doing this is this application get the permission to operate this project. 

![Openshift UI](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/jenkins.png?raw=true)

When the deployment finish you should see something like this:

![Jenkins Deployment](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/jenkins-deploy.png?raw=true)

Now you just need to click the router link (https://jenkins-helloworld.127.0.0.1…, for the case below.), this will take you to the Jenkins home. 

![Jenkins Home](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/jenkins-home.png?raw=true)

### Configuring Maven

In this example project we are using Maven, but instructions should be similar if you are using other package manager. Now we need to go to: 

Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins. 

![Manage Plugins](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/Manage.png?raw=true)


Install Pipeline Maven Integration Jenkins Plugin, Then just press the button install without restart.

![Maven Integration Plugin](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/Maven%20Plugin.png?raw=true)

We now need to install Maven globally for Jenkins, navigate to Manage Jenkins (Again) -> Global Tool Configuration

![Maven Configuration](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/MavenConfig.png?raw=true)

Then go to the Maven section and choose your Maven version, for this guide I will choose 3.5.3 and set the name to **Maven353** as we going to need it later.

Then press save. We finish the boring part, let’s create our pipeline. 


<br><br>
### Creating Jenkins Pipeline Project

We need to create a Jenkins Pipeline, easy we just need to go to the home, press the menu **new items** and choose a name for your project and check Pipeline option. 

![Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/newPipeline.png?raw=true)


<br><br>
#### Adding Some Flexibility 

One way to make our pipeline more reusable is to allow the build to accept custom parameters, is very useful if we want to clone and reuse, to activate it we need to check the box "this project is parameterized" and then we are going to create 3 parameters: 

* **GIT_URL** 
  We set here the git repository, example: https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot 

* **BUILD_CONFIG** 
  We need here the name of our builder configuration object you can check this in the Openshift Console or by doing: 
  ```oc get bc```

* **DEPLOY_CONFIG** 
  This maybe is not necessary for simple projects but if you are doing something more sophisticated it can become handy, to see list your deployment config do:
  ```oc get dc```

We should end up with something like this: 

![Env vars](https://github.com/cesarvr/Spring-Boot/blob/master/docs/EnvVars.png?raw=true)

<br><br>
### Pipeline Script  
#### Getting Started

First we need to declare the node where this pipeline will get executed, as we are going to use a standalone Jenkins local to our config project we can keep it simple.

```
node { 
  // Declare stages here 

}
```

#### Preparation 

In the first stage we are going to clone the repository **GIT_CLONE** and declare a mvnHome pointing to our Maven configuration **Maven353** defined above.  

```
node { 
 // Declare stages here 
 def mvnHome

 stage('Preparation') { 

     // Get some code from a GitHub repository
     git "${params.GIT_URL}"

     // Get the Maven tool.
     // ** NOTE: This 'M3' Maven tool must be configured
     // **       in the global configuration.           
     mvnHome = tool 'Maven353'
 }
}
``` 

#### Unit Test

Once we got the code we run the test task, I put there a little hack at the end because the process ends with a non-zero value in the case that test fail and I want to read the report after that.  

```
 stage('Build & Test in Jenkins') {
    // Run the maven build
    sh "'${mvnHome}/bin/mvn' test || exit 0"
 }

``` 

#### Report

Everytime we run a report is generated. Here we just read that report and extract the state of the build, if a test fails the build is marked as unstable.  

```
 stage('Generating Unit Test Report') {
    junit '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'
 }
 
``` 

#### Build & Deploy

Here I check the status of the deployment if the build is unstable then I just ignore this step and finish the build. If the build state is successful state then I tell our project to start the build. 

```
stage('Build & Deploy in Openshift') {
      /*
       * User and password should be provided by a Jenkins Credential Manager
       * Also we check the Build Status as we don't want to deploy code that is not 100% unit tested.
       *
       *  $BUILD_CONFIG, $DC_CONFIG are Jenkins project parameters we declared above. 
       *
       */
      if(currentBuild.result != 'UNSTABLE')
      sh '''
            oc login <IP-Address> --token=k3NFaYRHiTwS2KpJNBldS9.... --insecure-skip-tls-verify

            #We push our generated binaries and start an Openshift build.
            oc start-build $BUILD_CONFIG --from-dir=\'.\' -F

            #After build is finish, we now look watch the deployment.
            oc rollout status $DC_CONFIG -w

            #Bye Bye...
            oc logout'''
   }

```


This line log us in Openshift project, you can get the token using oc whoami -t , the IP address is the one of your Openshift installation. 

```
oc login 192.168.65.2:8443 --token=bMG7rvw71f_z8w... --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

Here we tell Openshift to make a new [build](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/dev_guide/builds.html) and we want to push the content of this folder. This will speed up the image generation speed. 

```
oc start-build $BUILD_CONFIG --from-dir=\'.\' -F 
```

After this step finishes we just wait for the [deployment](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/deployments.html) phase to finish.

```
oc rollout status $DEPLOY_CONFIG -w 
```

Here you can find the definition for the command we are using here: 

* [oc login](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)
* [oc start-build](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#start-build)
* [oc rollout](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#viewing-a-deployment)
